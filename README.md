# Coin Bot Development

Hello. This repository is all about developing CoinBot, A discord bot made by [Science Done Right.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIwQRdmuOVVLnPCo5ngSg_w)
This repository is supposed to be accessed by only developers of the bot.

Unauthorised access is not allowed. Please read everything below this.
After this, read `rules.md` for more info on what to do and not to do here.

### Running the bot
To run the bot, go to the [repl.it project](https://replit.com/@CodeDoneRight/Science-done-right-bot#main.py) and run the bot.
You can run the bot to:
- Add new features
- Remove old features
- Run the bot
- Repair, upgrade or make bugfixes.

###### Note that you are not allowed to commit incorrect, outdated, irrelevant or slow code.
Before commiting ANYTHING, Please test in your custom bot. Make your own bot in the discord developer portal which will be linked below.
After that please test any features you want to add to the bot.

These "testing" bots aren't supposed to have all of coin bot's code. Instead have only ~3 features in it at maximum.

To test bugs, copy and paste bug prone or bugged out areas in your own test bot. Try to find a fix and add it to your staging area. Please provide a detailed description on what you're doing and what you've done so far.
Thanks!

**Have a fun time!**
